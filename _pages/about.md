I graduated with a Master of Science MSc in Life Sciences Engineering in February 2021 at the [EPFL School of Life Sciences](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/sv/). I focused my studies on computational neuroscience, AI, data analysis and biomechanics.

After my graduation, I worked 3 months as a Research Assistant on the intersection of AI and Neuroscience in the [Bertarelli Foundation Chair of Integrative Neuroscience Laboratory](https://www.mackenziemathislab.org/) at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), in continuation of my Master's Thesis conducted under the supervision of [Prof. Mackenzie Mathis, PhD](https://people.epfl.ch/mackenzie.mathis/?lang=en) and [Asim Iqbal, PhD](https://itsasimiqbal.github.io/).  
I developed pipelines to analyze months of continuously recorded mouse behavior in an enriched environment. In particular, I used [DeepLabCut](http://www.mackenziemathislab.org/deeplabcut) for animal pose estimation, [Detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2)'s implementation of Mask R-CNN for instance segmentation. I also designed and implemented a 2D to 3D object lifting pipeline by regressing the location and orientation of large objects with 3D meshes and computing the centroid of point objects.

I worked from September 2019 to July 2020 as a Junior Data Scientist at [Metadvice](https://www.metadvice.com/), where I developed deep learning based methods to provide decision support to clinicians for diagnosis and treatment planning of 3 cardiometabolic diseases, based on clinical guidelines. I conjointly measured the translational gap in the diagnosis and treatment planning of cardiometabolic diseases based on a medical dataset of 6,700 patients from a London group practice.

During my Master, I also worked in the [Bertarelly Chair in Translational Neural Engineering Laboratory](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/tne/) for my Minor Project in Computational Neurosciences under the supervision of [Prof. Silvestro Micera](https://people.epfl.ch/silvestro.micera) and [Th√©o Lemaire, PhD](https://people.epfl.ch/theo.lemaire/?lang=en). I focused my Master's course selection on classes with substantial projects to gain advanced theoretical knowledge while improving my coding skills and approach to engineering challenges.   
I previously obtained a Bachelor of Science BSc in Life Sciences Engineering, also at EPFL, which provided me with a solid polytechnic education based on multidisciplinary skills. I did my Bachelor's Thesis in the lab of [Prof. Friedhelm Christoph Hummel](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/hummel-lab/).
