I am currently working as a Research Assistant on the intersection of AI and Neuroscience in the [Bertarelli Foundation Chair of Integrative Neuroscience Laboratory](https://www.mackenziemathislab.org/) at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), in continuation of my Master's Thesis conducted under the supervision of [Prof. Mackenzie Mathis, PhD](https://people.epfl.ch/mackenzie.mathis/?lang=en) and [Asim Iqbal, PhD](https://itsasimiqbal.github.io/).

I graduated with a Master of Science MSc in Life Sciences Engineering in February 2021 at the [EPFL School of Life Sciences](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/sv/). I focused my studies on computational neuroscience, biomechanics, AI and data analysis. In addition to my Master's Thesis, I also worked in the [Bertarelly Chair in Translational Neural Engineering Laboratory](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/tne/) for my Minor Project in Computational Neurosciences under the supervision of [Prof. Silvestro Micera](https://people.epfl.ch/silvestro.micera) and [Th√©o Lemaire, PhD](https://people.epfl.ch/theo.lemaire/?lang=en). I previously obtained a Bachelor of Science BSc in Life Sciences Engineering, also at EPFL, which provided me with a solid polytechnic education based on multidisciplinary skills. I did my Bachelor's Thesis in the lab of [Prof. Friedhelm Christoph Hummel](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/hummel-lab/).
